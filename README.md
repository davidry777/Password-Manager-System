# Credit Card System

### Description

This was a project to demonstrate my Python programming skills.

This project first generates a default password list with websites, usernames, and passwords from a text file.
Each website contains a list of usernames, and each username has access to the password. A user can create a
new password, either by having the user enter their new password or having the program generate a
15-character password. The user can also print out the list, change a password, and change a username.
